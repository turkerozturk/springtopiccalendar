# Daily Topic Tracker
Daily Topic Tracker, a Java Spring Boot application with SQLite database.

## How to Run

Download the file to your computer. No installation required. It will work if Java is installed on your computer.

Run with this console command;

java -jar daily-topic-tracker-1.0.0.jar

Copy and paste the link below into your web browser:

http://localhost:8080/

You need to create one or more categories, one or more topics, and then you can add entries for the topics.

If you want to generate test data, create a file named application.properties in the same folder. Then paste the text dummy.database.create=1 into it, save it and run the application.

Whether the database is empty or contains test data, it will be created in the same folder by default with the name mydatabase.db.
