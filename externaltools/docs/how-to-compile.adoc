==== What is LaunchDTT?

It is a separate launcher app to run the main application project.

It is not necessary. But it makes the running process comfortable.

==== How it is made?
I gave the instructions to the artificial intelligence to develop it.

At first, I requested it as an AutoIT file. With a few questions it developed a working script.

Then I requested to convert it from AutoIT to Java Swing application.

orphan/WindowsLauncher.au3 file is deprecated.
