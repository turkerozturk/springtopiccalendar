## HOW TO USE

You need to create one or more category-groups, categories, topics, and then you can add entries for the topics.

If you want to generate test data, open the file named application.properties in the same folder. Then change the text dummy.database.create=0 to dummy.database.create=1, save it and run the application. If a database exist already, inserting test data will not work for existing data security.

Whether the database is empty or contains test data, it will be created in the same folder by default with the name mydatabase.db.

## File: application.properties

Change these settings if you want:

spring.security.user.password={noop}admin

app.timezone=Europe/Istanbul

week.start.day=SUNDAY

server.port=8080
